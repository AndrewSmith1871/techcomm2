# How to Jump Start a Car

At some point in your life you may find yourself with a dead car battery leaving you stranded.   This brief set of instructions will explain to you how to remedy your situation, assuming of course another kind individual with an automobile nearby is willing to help.  

Make sure that you have 2 jumper cables(one red and one black)

# Instructions

1. Check the voltage of both the dead battery and the donor battery, if the voltage does not match this will not work.  
2. Position the donor car nearby the dead car, ensure that both cars have the parking brakes applied, and that the ignition is off.  If you are on the side of a busy road activate your hazard lights.  
3. Open the hood of each car.  
4. Attach one end of the RED cable to the POSITIVE terminal on the DEAD battery.  
5. Attach the other end of the RED cable to the POSITIVE terminal of the DONOR battery.  
6. Attach one end of the BLACK cable to the NEGATIVE terminal of the DONOR battery.  
7. Attach the other end of the BLACK cable to a BARE SECTION OF METAL on the DEAD car further away from the dead battery.  
8. Start the donor car and allow it to idle for a few minutes.  
9. After some time has passed attempt to start the dead car.  
10. If the dead car starts then move on the the next step.  If the dead car does not start, make sure that all connections are correct and try again.  
11. After the dead car has started you can then remove the clips in the REVERSE order they were attached(step 7 -> step 6 -> step 5 -> step 4)
12. Finally you may close the hood, thank the kind indivual, and continue on your way.  (You should keep the car running for at least 10 minutes after the jump start to ensure that the battery does not die again.)
